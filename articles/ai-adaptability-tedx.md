# AI and the Art of Adaptability | TEDx Talk

*Originally published on LinkedIn â€¢ July 11, 2023*

In the rapidly evolving world of technology, artificial intelligence (AI) stands out as one of the most significant developments I've had the opportunity to witness in my years working in technology and operations at companies like ActionVFX.

This was the foundation of my TEDx talk titled "AI and the Art of Adaptability." In it, I share my thoughts on the transformative potential of AI, the necessity of adaptability, and the importance of reskilling.

## Understanding AI

AI refers to the development of computer systems and software that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. 

In simpler terms, AI allows machines to mimic or simulate human thinking and reasoning. It's fascinating to see how AI has seamlessly integrated into our daily lives, from recommending shows on our favorite streaming platforms to setting reminders on our phones.

## AI and Disruption

I acknowledged the disruptive potential of AI, particularly in the workplace. With the advent of AI and automation, the existing workforce must adapt to these changes. However, this disruption isn't something to fear; instead, it's an opportunity for growth and innovation.

It's true that AI holds disruptive potential, particularly within the workplace. With AI and automation becoming more prevalent, the nature of work is undeniably changing. It's not just about the tasks AI can undertake, but the potential to reshape work structures, processes, and cultures.

## The Painful Concept of Reskilling

Reskilling, or learning new skills to adapt to changing job requirements, is not a new concept. However, in the face of rapid technological advancements, it's becoming increasingly important. Reskilling can be a challenging process, but it's ultimately worth it. It allows individuals to stay relevant and competitive in the evolving job market.

While the process of reskilling might be daunting, it's essential to view it as an investment in oneself and one's career. Furthermore, reskilling opens doors to opportunities that might not have existed in traditional job roles, thus bringing an element of excitement and novelty to one's professional journey.

## The Role of Leaders in Promoting Adaptability

Leaders play a crucial role in promoting adaptability within organizations. They can foster adaptability by providing psychologically safe environments for their teams. In such environments, individuals feel free to ask questions, explore new ideas, and adapt to changes without fear of negative consequences.

Leadership, in the context of AI and adaptability, isn't merely about guidance; it's about being a visionary who can anticipate change, plan strategically, and navigate teams through uncharted territories. Leaders who succeed in this era will be those who not only understand the intricacies of AI but can also foster an organizational culture that thrives on continual learning and adaptability.

## Encouraging a Love of Learning

Fostering a love of learning is another key aspect of promoting adaptability. A love of learning not only allows us to meet our full potential but also makes us more adaptable to change and new environments.

Promoting a culture of learning goes beyond the idea of merely acquiring new skills or knowledge. It's about creating an environment that values curiosity, encourages intellectual growth, and promotes a passion for understanding the world in new and different ways. It's about creating a sense of wonder and a desire to explore the unknown.

## The Potential of AI to Improve Efficiency

Beyond its capacity to automate tasks and boost productivity, AI also frees us to focus on what humans do best: creativity, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence. As routine tasks are handled by AI, we can direct our energy toward driving innovation.

As we navigate this new landscape, I believe we're not just cogs in a machine but the architects and innovators entrusted to shape the future. Let's seize this moment and step forward with confidence, adaptability, and a commitment to learning.

So let's not blow it.
