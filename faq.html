            <div class="faq-answer">
                My process is designed to deliver results quickly while building sustainable long-term systems:
                <br><br>
                <strong>Phase 1: Discovery (Week 1-2)</strong>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">How quickly can I see results from operations optimization?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                Most clients see immediate improvements within the first 2-4 weeks through quick wins and process optimizations. Larger transformations typically show significant results within 60-90 days, with ongoing improvements as systems mature.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Typical Timeline:</strong>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Can you guarantee specific results?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                While I can't guarantee specific numerical outcomes (every business is different), I can guarantee:
                <ul>
                    <li>You'll receive proven frameworks that have worked for other businesses</li>
                    <li>Implementation will be hands-on, not just theoretical advice</li>
                    <li>You'll have functioning systems by the end of our engagement</li>
                    <li>Your team will be trained to maintain and improve the systems</li>
