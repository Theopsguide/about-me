        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>You started your business to grow and serve customers. Not to get buried in operations. Yet, many business owners find themselves drowning in repetitive tasks that automation could handle.</p>
        
        <p>I get it. As a COO, I spent years optimizing workflows, building efficient teams, and using automation to scale operations. The result? Our company grew into an industry leaderâ€”by working smarter.</p>
        
        <p>Now, through The Operations Guide, I help business owners streamline operations, automate the busywork, and build scalable systems. All without needing a tech background.</p>
        
        <p>My approach is simple: no jargon, just practical strategies and results that free up your time and let you focus on what matters.</p>
        
        <p>ðŸš€ Want to work ON your business instead of IN it? Reach out to me.</p>
