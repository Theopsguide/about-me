## About Me

You started your business to grow and serve customers. Not to get buried in operations. Yet, many business owners find themselves drowning in repetitive tasks that automation could handle.

I get it. As a COO, I spent years optimizing workflows, building efficient teams, and using automation to scale operations. The result? Our company grew into an industry leaderâ€”by working smarter.

Now, through The Operations Guide, I help business owners streamline operations, automate the busywork, and build scalable systems. All without needing a tech background.

My approach is simple: no jargon, just practical strategies and results that free up your time and let you focus on what matters.
