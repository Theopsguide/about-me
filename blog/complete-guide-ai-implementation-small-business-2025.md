### ROI Calculation Framework

**Formula:**
ROI = (Benefits - Costs) / Costs × 100

**Benefit Categories:**
1. **Time Savings** (hourly rate × hours saved)
2. **Cost Reductions** (direct cost eliminations)
3. **Revenue Growth** (increased sales/productivity)
4. **Error Prevention** (cost of errors avoided)

**Example Calculation (Medium Business):**

**Costs (Year 1):**
- Implementation: $25,000
- Tools: $36,000 (12 months × $3,000)
- Training: $10,000
- **Total: $71,000**

**Benefits (Year 1):**
- Time savings: $85,000 (10 hours/week × $40/hour × 50 employees × 52 weeks × 20% efficiency gain)
- Cost reductions: $35,000 (reduced customer service staffing)
- Revenue growth: $50,000 (improved conversion rates)
- **Total: $170,000**

**ROI: (170,000 - 71,000) / 71,000 × 100 = 139%**

### Payback Period Analysis
